    The way cookies work is to store your data in session which allows the server to tell whether or not you are logged in, 
    or how many times a page has been loaded.  Odds are, if you're reading this on my actual site, you are either from 
    a potential employer (and know very well how cookies are used), or you are an acquaintance who is just clicking on stuff.  
    I hope this explanation has been satisfactory.</p>
