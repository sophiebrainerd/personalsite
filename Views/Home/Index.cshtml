        <p class="col-lg">I'm a junior developer and coding bootcamp graduate located in the DC area.  I recently finished a 14-week program with Coding Dojo, but
        I have been coding on and off for years, with my <a href="https://repl.it/@@sophiebrainerd/EverlastingRustyBug" style="color: #7d050f">first solo project</a> being a "Go Fish!" console game 
        made in Python back in 2017.  Having now turned my focus towards coding full time, I've learned to create full stack projects using Django, React, and C#.  Please check them out on my 
        <a href="/projects" style="color: #7d050f">projects page</a> or <a href="https://github.com/sophiebrainerd" style="color: #7d050f">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p class="col-lg">Prior to starting my career in web development, I worked in various industries including retail, hospitality, security, solid waste, and administrative work.
        I know how to make a bone dry capuccino and can back up a tractor trailer.  I graduated from poker dealing school and was a state certified alarm monitor.  Learning
        about new topics and putting that knowledge to use is my <span style="font-weight: 600">passion</span>.</p>
        <p class="col-lg">Most of the projects I've created independently have been in C# and my professional (and personal) ambitions lie in game development.
        My current focus is in learning to create games with Unity, and plan to add C++ to my repertoire in the near future.</p>
